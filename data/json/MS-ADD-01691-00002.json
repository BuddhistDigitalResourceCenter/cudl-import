The exact date is now illegible. Dr. D. Wright read it as Nepāla 299, but, as argued by Petech (1984: 64), this seems to be impossible because the date would fall outside the reign of Ānandadeva (1099-1167), the king supposedly mentioned in the colophon, although the portion with his name is now almost completely broken off. Moreover, the date read by Dr. D. Wright cannot be verified, while it might be verified for the following days: Saturday, October 8th, 1149; October 4th, 1152; October 20th, 1156; October 17th, 1158; November 5th, 1166. The manuscript contains a Buddhist text called <i>Kurukullākalpa</i>, a ritual manual dedicated to the tantric goddess Kurukullā. The work is divided into a few chapters with various ritual instructions, including obtaining supernatural powers (<i>siddhi</i>). This manuscript was used in the critical edition done by the 84000 project in 2011. </p>"],"abstractShort":[" A certain Rāṇaṭhaku commmissioned this Nepalese palm-leaf manuscript from the second half of the 12th century.
