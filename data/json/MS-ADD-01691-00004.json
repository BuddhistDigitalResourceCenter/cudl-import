{"thumbnailOrientation":["landscape"],"shelfLocator":["MS Add.1691.4"],"abstractText":["<p style='text-align: justify;'>A 15th-century palm-leaf manuscript of the <i>Cāndravyākaraṇa</i> by the Buddhist grammarian Candragomin, containing the <i>sūtrapāṭha</i> without any commentary. The initial folios are missing, and the surviving portion begins with what looks like the end of <i>Cāndravyākaraṇa</i> 1.4.12 (<i>vido laṭo vā</i>) in a slight modified form (the particle <i>vā</i> is missing); <i>sūtra</i>s 13 and 14 as they are found in the printed editions are omitted, and the first complete <i>sūtra</i> is 1.4.15. The manuscript contains all six sections (<i>adhyāya</i>s) of Candragomin's grammar. One remarkable feature is its almost generalised use of a sign for the <i>avagraha</i> marking the elision of an initial short \"a\" in certain sandhi phenomena. </p>"],"abstractShort":["A 15th-century palm-leaf manuscript of the Cāndravyākaraṇa by the Buddhist grammarian Candragomin, containing the sūtrapāṭha"],"id":["MS-ADD-01691-00004"],"imageReproPageURL":["http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/digital-content-unit/licensing-images"],"title":["Cāndravyākaraṇa"],"thumbnailURL":["https://image02.cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/content/images/MS-ADD-01691-00004-000-00001_files/8/0_0.jpg"],"authors":[[{"authorityURI":"VIAF","role":"author","authority":"http://viaf.org/","valueURI":"http://viaf.org/viaf/46773592","fullForm":"Candragomin","type":"person","displayForm":"Candragomin"}]]}
