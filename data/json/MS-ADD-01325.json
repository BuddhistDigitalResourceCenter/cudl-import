The earliest evidence for texts grouped together as the \"Five Great Dhāraṇīs\" comes from Tibetan catalogues around 800 CE, but this compendium is somewhat different from the surviving Sanskrit collection, which is preserved in manuscripts dating back to the eleventh century. These scriptures include spells, enumerations of benefits and ritual instructions for use. With the course of time all of them became deified and five related goddesses emerged. It is, however, important to note that the texts themselves do not have any references to these goddesses. This paper manuscript, dated to 1819 CE, is a quite recent exemplar of the corpus, which testifies to its importance in early modernity as well. </p>"],"abstractShort":[" The Pañcarakṣā corpus (\"Five Protections\") consists of the Mahāpratisarā, Mahāmāyūrī, Mahāsāhasrapramardanī, Mahāmantrānusāriṇī,"],"id":["MS-ADD-01325"],"imageReproPageURL":["http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/digital-content-unit/licensing-images"],"title":["Pañcarakṣā"],"thumbnailURL":["/img/no-thumbnail.jpg"],"authors":[[]]}
