He is a so-called 'lineage-deity' (<i>degu/deguli</i>), the focus of special devotion by several Newar monasteries, including the famous Golden Temple in Patan. Unlike other significant tantric deities, Yogāmbara does not have a central scripture of his own. His cult probably has its ancient origins in Eastern India. </p>"],"abstractShort":["This Nepalese paper manuscript, written in Kathmandu by a certain Tailapati in 1834 in the mahāvihāra called Ratnaketu, contains"],"id":["MS-ADD-01383"],"imageReproPageURL":["http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/digital-content-unit/licensing-images"],"title":["Yogāmbarasamādhipūjāpaddhati"],"thumbnailURL":["https://image02.cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/content/images/MS-ADD-01383-000-00001_files/8/0_0.jpg"],"authors":[[]]}
