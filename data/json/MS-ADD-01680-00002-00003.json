{"thumbnailOrientation":["landscape"],"shelfLocator":["MS Add.1680.2.3"],"abstractText":["<p style='text-align: justify;'> The <i>Avadānaśataka</i> is an ancient collection of Buddhist legends, its first redaction dating to the first centuries of the CE. It was translated into Chinese and Tibetan during the first millennium CE, gaining large popularity across Asia. This Nepalese incomplete palm-leaf manuscript consists of one single folio containing the second half of the <i>Anāthapiṇḍadāvadāna</i>, the thirty-ninth story in the collection. The verso, numbered 18, contains only four lines and ends with the final rubric of this <i>avadāna</i>. In <a target='_blank' class='externalLink' href='http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-ADD-01611/1'>Add. 1611</a>, the <i>Anāthapiṇḍadāvadāna</i> is already a short story, and in the recension represented in this manuscript the longer formulaic passages are absent (Formigatti 2016). It is therefore probable that the manuscript contained other <i>avadāna</i>s. This folio is part of a bundle of nine folios possibly from four different manuscripts, containing parts of five stories from the <i>Avadānaśataka</i>. They were used by Speyer for his edition of the <i>Avadānaśataka</i> and were given the siglum F. <p>A complete diplomatic transcription of this fragment is provided in the section \"View more options.\"</p> </p>"],"abstractShort":[" The Avadānaśataka is an ancient collection of Buddhist legends, its first redaction dating to the first centuries of the"],"id":["MS-ADD-01680-00002-00003"],"imageReproPageURL":["http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/digital-content-unit/licensing-images"],"title":["Avadānaśataka"],"thumbnailURL":["https://image02.cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/content/images/MS-ADD-01680-00002-00003-000-00001_files/8/0_0.jpg"],"authors":[[]]}
