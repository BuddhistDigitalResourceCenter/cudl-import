{"thumbnailOrientation":["landscape"],"shelfLocator":["MS Add.1680.8.2"],"abstractText":["<p style='text-align: justify;'>This fragmentary palm-leaf manuscript of a <i>Dhāraṇīsaṃgraha</i> is part of a bundle of a few manuscripts (Add.1680.8), all seemingly composed of collections of <i>dhāraṇī</i>s. Three different manuscripts, all from around the 12th-13th century, have been tentatively identified on the basis of the (often deficient) foliation and of the layout (string hole in a square blank space, string hole in a column-like blank space or an alternation of the two). Further research might shed more light on the subdivision of the whole manuscript bundle. This identified manuscript has only 2 folios, numbered as 9 and 11, and is characterized by square blank spaces for the string hole on one side and column-like blank spaces on the other. </p>"],"abstractShort":["This fragmentary palm-leaf manuscript of a Dhāraṇīsaṃgraha is part of a bundle of a few manuscripts (Add.1680.8), all seemingly"],"id":["MS-ADD-01680-00008-00002"],"imageReproPageURL":["http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/digital-content-unit/licensing-images"],"title":["Dhāraṇīsaṃgraha"],"thumbnailURL":["https://image02.cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/content/images/MS-ADD-01680-00008-00002-000-00001_files/8/0_0.jpg"],"authors":[[]]}
