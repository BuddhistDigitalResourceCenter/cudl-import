{"thumbnailOrientation":["landscape"],"shelfLocator":["MS Add.1657.1"],"abstractText":["<p style='text-align: justify;'>An incomplete Nepalese manuscript of the <i>Cāndravyākaraṇapañjikā</i> of Ratnamati , an unpublished commentary on the <i>Cāndravyākaraṇa</i> of the Buddhist grammarian Candragomin (probably 5th c. CE) and the <i>Vṛtti</i> attributed to Dharmadāsa . The work has been identified with the help of Dragomir Dimitrov (Marburg) and Mahesh Deokar (Pune). The former is preparing the <i>editio princeps</i> of the <i>Pañjikā</i> on the basis of one incomplete manuscript kept in the Kaiser Library in Kathmandu (Dimitrov 2010a: 25-26). According to Dimitrov (2010b: 41-44; 2014: 595-700), the grammarian Ratnamati is the same as Ratnaśrījñāna, a Sinhalese Buddhist monk who composed a commentary on Daṇḍin 's <i>Kāvyādarśa</i> in the first half of the 10th c. CE, and who also wrote works in Sinhalese and Pāli under the name of Upatissa. The manuscript contains the commentary on section 2 (<i>pāda</i>, literally “quarter”) of chapter 2 (<i>adhyāya</i>) of Candragomin's grammar. It appears to comment on most but not all rules, which are given in abbreviated form. For example, on <a href='' onclick='store.loadPage(6);return false;'>f. 2v2</a>, to the right of the string hole, the term <i>asaṃ</i> is a reference to <i>sūtra</i> 2.2.2, <i>asaṃkhyaṃ</i> <i class='reg' style='font-style:normal;' title='String hyphenated for display.

The text stops in the middle of the commentary on the last rule of the section, namely 2.2.87, <i>lug anādiluky agoṇyādīnām</i>, on <a href='' onclick='store.loadPage(112);return false;'>f. 71v5</a>. </p>"],"abstractShort":["An incomplete Nepalese manuscript of the Cāndravyākaraṇapañjikā of Ratnamati , an unpublished commentary on the Cāndravyākaraṇa"],"id":["MS-ADD-01657-00001"],"imageReproPageURL":["http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/digital-content-unit/licensing-images"],"title":["Cāndravyākaraṇapañjikā"],"thumbnailURL":["https://image02.cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/content/images/MS-ADD-01657-00001-000-00001_files/8/0_0.jpg"],"authors":[[{"authorityURI":"VIAF","role":"author","authority":"http://viaf.org/","valueURI":"http://viaf.org/viaf/","fullForm":"Ratnamati","type":"person","displayForm":"Ratnamati"}]]}
