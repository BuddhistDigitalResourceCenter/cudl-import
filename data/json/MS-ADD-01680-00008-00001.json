{"thumbnailOrientation":["landscape"],"shelfLocator":["MS Add.1680.8.1"],"abstractText":["<p style='text-align: justify;'>This fragmentary palm-leaf manuscript of a <i>Dhāraṇīsaṃgraha</i> is part of a bundle of a few manuscripts (Add.1680.8), all seemingly composed of collections of <i>dhāraṇī</i>s. Three different manuscripts, all from around the 12th-13th century, have been tentatively identified on the basis of the (often deficient) foliation and of the layout (string hole in a square blank space, string hole in a column-like blank space or an alternation of the two). Further research might shed more light on the subdivision of the whole manuscript bundle. This identified manuscript has 15 folio. The foliation of some of them is repeated; therefore, they might have originally belonged to different manuscripts. Two folios are beautifully illuminated. </p>"],"abstractShort":["This fragmentary palm-leaf manuscript of a Dhāraṇīsaṃgraha is part of a bundle of a few manuscripts (Add.1680.8), all seemingly"],"id":["MS-ADD-01680-00008-00001"],"imageReproPageURL":["http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/digital-content-unit/licensing-images"],"title":["Dhāraṇīsaṃgraha"],"thumbnailURL":["https://image02.cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/content/images/MS-ADD-01680-00008-00001-000-00001_files/8/0_0.jpg"],"authors":[[]]}
