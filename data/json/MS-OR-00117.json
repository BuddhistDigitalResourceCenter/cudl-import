He has been reduced to poverty and so requests a sermon from the Lord so that he may provide for his own family and so that all beings may become prosperous. This scripture includes a <i>dhāraṇī</i> along with enumerations of benefits and ritual instructions for use. As testified also by this paper manuscript, dated 1740 CE and clearly written in a jaina scriptorium, the Buddhist <i>Vasudhāradhāraṇī</i> is a text in use also within Jainism (See Jaini 1968). </p>"],"abstractShort":[" The Vasudhāradhāraṇī, dedicated to Vasudhārā, the bodhisattva of wealth, prosperity, and abundance (who has a strong following"],"id":["MS-OR-00117"],"imageReproPageURL":["http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/digital-content-unit/licensing-images"],"title":["Vasudhārādhāraṇī"],"thumbnailURL":["/img/no-thumbnail.jpg"],"authors":[[]]}
