The earliest evidence for texts grouped together as the \"Five Great Dhāraṇīs\" comes from Tibetan catalogues around 800 CE, but this compendium is somewhat different from the surviving Sanskrit collection, which is preserved in manuscripts dating back to the eleventh century. These scriptures include spells, enumerations of benefits and ritual instructions for use. With the course of time all of them became deified and five related goddesses emerged. It is, however, important to note that the texts themselves do not have any references to these goddesses. This ancient palm leaf manuscript can be dated to approximately the 13th century CE. The last two folios are later supplies, still in palm leaf, dated to 1619 CE. Both wood covers are original and finely decorated with representations of the Buddhas and the goddesses of protection, which are now unfortunately badly damaged. </p>"],"abstractShort":[" The Pañcarakṣā corpus (\"Five Protections\") consists of the Mahāpratisarā, Mahāmāyūrī, Mahāsāhasrapramardanī, Mahāmantrānusāriṇī,"],"id":["MS-ADD-01662"],"imageReproPageURL":["http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/collections/departments/digital-content-unit/licensing-images"],"title":["Pañcarakṣā"],"thumbnailURL":["https://image02.cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/content/images/MS-ADD-01662-000-00001_files/8/0_0.jpg"],"authors":[[]]}
