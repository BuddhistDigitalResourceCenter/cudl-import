The manuscript was commissioned as an object of worship, probably by a group of Buddhist monks.

Dr. D.

Moreover, the date read by Dr. D.

"MS-OR-00158-00001","<p style='text-align: justify;'>A palm-leaf manuscript of the <i>Vajrāmṛtatantra</i>, one of the main Yoginītantras, which until now was known only through the Tibetan translation of the lo tsā ba Gyi jo zla ba’i ’od zer (10th-11th cent.) and through the indirect tradition. To date, only few verses of this <i>tantra</i> could have been read in the original Sanskrit. Although certainly less influential than other <i>Yoginītantra</i>s, such as, in primis, the <i>Hevajratantra</i>, the <i>Vajrāmṛtamahātantra</i> must have enjoyed a certain popularity. For instance, it is referred to as one of the authoritative sources for the practice of the <i>bāhyahoma</i> by Bhūvācārya (early 11th cent. ?), the author of the <i>Saṃvarodayā nāma Maṇḍalopāyikā</i>, in the <i>bāhyādhyātmahomavidhiḥ</i>, the eleventh chapter of his work. In addition, we should point out that this <i>tantra</i> has been commented at least three times. Two of the commentaries are extant in the original Sanskrit but are still unpublished. Originally, Or.158 was formed of palm leaves from two independent manuscripts, both fragmentary, one containing the <i>Vajrāmṛtatantra</i> and one containing the <i>Buddhakapālatantra</i>, another <i>yoginītantra</i>, so far published only in part (Luo 2010). Since the ductus, the quality and the shape of the leaves comprising these two works is the same (each leaf contains six lines, one string-hole dividing the writing area into two pseudocolumns, of which the left one is smaller than the right one, and on average 64/65 akṣaras), it is likely that at some point someone got confused and mistakenly put together leaves from these two works according to an apparently correct numerical sequence. The folios of the two works have been now rearranged into two distinct bundles (Or.158.1 and Or.158.2), each containing the extant folios of each work. It is highly plausible that together with these two works, a third one, namely the <i>Vajrāralimahātantrarāja</i>, made originally part of the same collection.

The earliest evidence for texts grouped together as the ""Five Great Dhāraṇīs"" comes from Tibetan catalogues around 800 CE, but this compendium is somewhat different from the surviving Sanskrit collection, which is preserved in manuscripts dating back to the eleventh century. These scriptures include spells, enumerations of benefits and ritual instructions for use. With the course of time all of them became deified and five related goddesses emerged. It is, however, important to note that the texts themselves do not have any references to these goddesses. This ancient palm-leaf manuscript is dated to 1205 CE, and was thus written during the reign of king Arimalla (1200-1216). The last folio, a later supply in paper, seems to accurately repeat the content of the last folio of the palm leaf manuscript, which is now extremely damaged (and was probably already damaged at the time of the production of the supply). Therefore, with the help of the transcription in the last folio, it is possible to reconstruct the original date, even if it is badly damaged in the original colophon (as Bendall puts it, ""[t]he date is especially remarkable, as it seems a clear instance of a copied date""; 1883: 153).

The paintings represent stories of both sacred and secular nature, often narrated along multiple pages, sometimes divided in two or three frames with the story evolving and the movement shifting from one composition to another. The stories are mostly taken from Brahmanical sources (the <i>Bhāgavatapurāṇa</i>, the <i>Mahābhārata</i>, the <i>Rāmāyaṇa</i> and the <i>Vetālapañcaviṃśati</i>) with the exception of ""the Buddhist Kinnarī Jātaka, a subject of abiding interest in Nepal.

Some folios display representations of some of the Mahāsiddhas, while others show horses from the <i>Aśvaśāstra</i> and sevaral scenes with various animals. This comparatively rare typology of manuscript, completely given over to pictures, is usually dubbed as <i>Kalāpustaka</i>.

The ""Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines"" (<i>Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā</i>) is one of the earliest Mahāyāna scriptures. This foundational <i>sūtra</i> of Mahāyāna Buddhism developed gradually over a period of about two hundred years, from the first century BCE to the first century CE (some of its earliest recensions were translated into Chinese during the Han dynasty, 206 BC – 220 CE). There is still no scholarly consensus as to the provenance of the text, but the most widespread view is that it was probably written in central or southern India. The ""Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines"" presents its doctrine in the form of a dialogue between the Buddha and one of his disciples, the <i>arhat</i> Subhūti. In this dialogue ""the principal ontological message (message concerning what ultimately exists) […] is an extension of the Buddhist teaching of not-Self to equal no essential unchanging core, therefore no fundamentally real existence, as applied to all things without exception"" (Williams 2009; 52). This <i>sūtra</i> belongs to the early stratum of the so-called ""Perfection of Wisdom (<i>prajñāpāramitā</i>) literature,"" subsequently expanded between the second and fourth centuries CE into other huge scriptures, for instance the ""Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines"" (the <i>Śatasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitā</i>). The ""Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Stanzas"" enjoyed a central role in the Buddhist cult of the book, and particularly in Newar Buddhism. ""This Nepalese palm-leaf manuscript of the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā is a unique item under many aspects. It is an important historical document that provides valuable information about the dynastic history of medieval Nepal. According to the colophon, it was written by a scribe named Sujātabhadra in 1015 CE during the joint reign of three kings, Bhojadeva , Rudradeva and Lakṣmīkāmadeva in the Hlāṃ <i>vihāra</i> (on the joint reign of these three kings cf. Petech 1984: 36-9). The identification of this monastery is still open: according to L. Petech it might be a misreading for Hloṃ, and is ""perhaps connected with present-day Lhom Hit in Tangal Tol, Patan"" (Petech 1984: 36-7); on the other hand, J. Locke identifies it with the Lām Bāhā in Kathmandu (Locke 1985: 421). Moreover, it is decorated with 85 miniatures occurring at chapter ends and at the beginning of the entire manuscript (probably the miniatures were originally 88, since the first palm-leaf folio is missing and has been replaced with a paper supplement). The subjects of these miniatures 'are in general different from their Indian Pāla counterparts. Apart from the last eight on the colophon folio […] they are all of specific iconographic representations of the Buddha or Bodhisattvas or other divinities, or of important stūpas or caityas. The majority of places designated are in eastern India, but there are some from far off places-China, Java, Ceylon, Gujarat, southern India' (Losty 1992: 31). Moreover, the manuscript contains notes for the illuminator added by the first scribe, each of which describes the Buddha or the Bodhisattva and the location to be depicted in the miniature. The importance of this manuscript is furthermore confirmed by an additional colophon in verses, added in 1139 by a certain Karuṇavajra , who states that he rescued the <i>Prajñāpāramitā</i> from falling in the hands of unbelievers (most probably, people of Brahmanical affiliation). Last but not least, the last folio of this manuscript is the only surviving witness of the Sanskrit original of the <i>Vajradhvajapariṇāmanā</i>, a short hymn hitherto considered to have survived only in its Tibetan translation, the <i>(’Phags pa) Rdo rje rgyal mtshan gyi yongs su bsngo ba</i> "" (Formigatti 2014: 14).

As noted by Liebich (1902), who used this manuscript for his edition of the Cāndra <i>Dhātupāṭha</i>, in the extant portion of the work the treatment of the roots of each of the ten verbal classes (<i>gaṇa</i>s) is confined to the present tense, called with the artificial term <i>laṭ</i> in the Cāndra and Pāṇinian terminology. The term appears in fact in the section rubrics of the manuscript. Liebich also remarks that the commentary shows traces of the influence of other <i>Dhātupāṭha</i> traditions (Pāṇini and Kātantra) despite Pūrṇacandra’s affiliation to the Cāndra school, which is shown e.g. by the form of the <i>pratyāhārasūtra</i>s found at the beginning of the work. The bundle also contains three additional folios, of seemingly related content, whose connection with the rest of the work is uncertain. The <i>Dhātupārāyaṇa</i> is as yet unpublished. According to Liebich (1895, p. 7) and, more recently, Verhagen (1994, p. 110 and 119), Pūrṇacandra’s work was known to the Tibetan grammatical tradition and was used by native translators of the Cāndra <i>Dhātupāṭha</i>. Nothing is known of Pūrṇacandra, but he is mentioned as the author of the <i>Śabdalakṣaṇavivaraṇapañjikā</i>, also unpublished, possibly a sub-commentary on the <i>Cāndravyākaraṇapañjikā</i> of Ratnamati (cf.

Rāmapāla was one of the four main disciples of Maitreyanātha . The title of the text could be translated into English as ""Commentary on the Explanation of Consecration.""

Then it continues with an explanation of the four moments (<i>kṣaṇa</i>) and the related blisses (<i>ānanda</i>) that are to be experienced during the higher phase of the initiation. The text and in particular the commentary refer to a debate between different Buddhist traditions regarding the sequence of the blisses and the nature of their experience, and its significance. Rāmapāla quotes several stanzas from the <i>Pramāṇavārttika</i> by Dharmakīrti and many passages from other Mahāyānic and Tantric works (in particular from the <i>Hevajratantra</i>).

"MS-ADD-01464","A palm-leaf manuscripts containing Rāhulabhadra 's <i>Prajñāpāramitāstotra</i> and the <i>Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā</i>. The 'Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines' (<i>Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā</i>) is one of the earliest Mahāyāna scriptures. This foundational sūtra of Mahāyāna Buddhism developed gradually over a period of about two hundred years, from the first century BCE to the first century CE (some of its earliest recensions were translated into Chinese during the Han dynasty, 206 BC – 220 CE). There is still no scholarly consensus as to the provenance of the text, but the most widespread view is that it was probably written in central or southern India. The 'Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines' presents its doctrine in the form of a dialogue between the Buddha and one of his disciples, the <i>arhat</i> Subhūti. In this dialogue ""the principal ontological message (message concerning what ultimately exists) […] is an extension of the Buddhist teaching of not-Self to equal no essential unchanging core, therefore no fundamentally real existence, as applied to all things without exception"" (Williams 2009; 52). This sūtra belongs to the early stratum of the so-called 'Perfection of Wisdom (<i>prajñāpāramitā</i>) literature,' subsequently expanded between the second and fourth centuries CE into other huge scriptures, for instance the 'Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines' (the <i>Śatasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitā</i>). The 'Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Stanzas' enjoyed a central role in the Buddhist cult of the book, and particularly in Newar Buddhism. This palm-leaf manuscript belongs to the Pāla tradition of illuminated manuscripts of the <i>Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā</i> in the ornamental Pāla script. The manuscript originally had six illuminated folios, each with three miniatures, but unfortunately the original first folio is missing. It has been replaced with a later palm-leaf folio without miniatures and in a different script. The date of the manuscript is controversial since in the colophon it is stated that it was copied in the fifth regnal year of the Pāla king Mahīpāla, but without specifying which of the two Pāla kings named Mahīpāla is meant. The fifth year of either is equivalent to c. 985 or after ca 1070, and since Mahīpāla II most probably reigned only for three years, the earliest date is more probable. The donor, a woman named Lāḍokā , is mentioned in the colophon. The manuscript is protected by two extremely beautiful painted wooden covers, both bearing traces of materials smeared during worship rites. <p style='text-align: justify;'> <iframe width=""600"" height=""480"" src=""https://www.youtube.com/embed/4Fw_p31bH7Y?list=PLoEBu2Q8ia_Plr7aQ7Twml69cRSfKI_3S"" frameborder=""0"" allowfullscreen></iframe> </p>","A palm-leaf manuscripts containing Rāhulabhadra 's Prajñāpāramitāstotra and the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā.

It is in three parts: the first part (in prose and verse) deals with the definition of a real brahmin (brāhmaṇa), and was sometimes read as a critique of the caste system; the second part (in prose and verse) considers various notions of liberation (<i>mokṣa</i>); the third part (prose only) deals with the interpretation of the upaniṣadic “Great Sayings” (<i>mahāvākya</i>s).

"MS-ADD-01278","<p style='text-align: justify;'>This Nepalese paper manuscript, dated 1866 CE, contains a Tantric Buddhist text called <i>Sarvadurgatipariśodhanasamādhi</i>, , belonging to the <i>Sarvadurgatipariśodhana</i> cycle. Most of the textual material of the present work is included in the so-called Version B of the <i>Sarvadurgatipariśodhanatantra</i> (see Skorupski 1983: xviii), where it susbtitues the 'Basic Tantra' (consisting of the description of the ritual <i>maṇḍala</i>). In the present text, the rite for the elimination of all evil destinies, aimed at procuring a better rebirth for the dead and a a better life for the living, is described in its different elements (for instance, the various <i>mantra</i>s, the visualization of <i>maṇḍala</i>s, the transference of merits, the vow for the development of the supreme Enlightment-mind, Skt. <i>bodhicitta</i> etc.). This manuscript seems to give particular importance to the hand-gestures (<i>mudrā</i>s) to be perfomed during the rite, which are carefully depicted in numerous polychrome illustrations throughout the book. As in the case of many other ritual texts from Nepal, the manuscript is an accordion book (or concertina), the ideal format to be read and consulted during the performance of often complex ritual practices. Possibly, the colophon recorded also the name of the owner of this manuscript, which has subsequently been erased (probably due to some change of ownership). </p>","This Nepalese paper manuscript, dated 1866 CE, contains a Tantric Buddhist text called Sarvadurgatipariśodhanasamādhi, ,","Sarvadurgatipariśodhanasamādhi","https://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/iiif/MS-ADD-01278","Sarvadurgatipariśodhanasamādhi","Ādiyogasamādhi,Sarvadurgatipariśodhanatantra"

The former is preparing the <i>editio princeps</i> of the <i>Pañjikā</i> on the basis of one incomplete manuscript kept in the Kaiser Library in Kathmandu (Dimitrov 2010a: 25-26). According to Dimitrov (2010b: 41-44; 2014: 595-700), the grammarian Ratnamati is the same as Ratnaśrījñāna, a Sinhalese Buddhist monk who composed a commentary on Daṇḍin 's <i>Kāvyādarśa</i> in the first half of the 10th c.

The manuscript contains the commentary on section 2 (<i>pāda</i>, literally “quarter”) of chapter 2 (<i>adhyāya</i>) of Candragomin's grammar.

The 'Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines' (<i>Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā</i>) is one of the earliest Mahāyāna scriptures. This foundational sūtra of Mahāyāna Buddhism developed gradually over a period of about two hundred years, from the first century BCE to the first century CE (some of its earliest recensions were translated into Chinese during the Han dynasty, 206 BC – 220 CE). There is still no scholarly consensus as to the provenance of the text, but the most widespread view is that it was probably written in central or southern India. The 'Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Lines' presents its doctrine in the form of a dialogue between the Buddha and one of his disciples, the <i>arhat</i> Subhūti. In this dialogue ""the principal ontological message (message concerning what ultimately exists) […] is an extension of the Buddhist teaching of not-Self to equal no essential unchanging core, therefore no fundamentally real existence, as applied to all things without exception"" (Williams 2009; 52). This sūtra belongs to the early stratum of the so-called 'Perfection of Wisdom (<i>prajñāpāramitā</i>) literature,' subsequently expanded between the second and fourth centuries CE into other huge scriptures, for instance the 'Perfection of Wisdom in One Hundred Thousand Lines' (the <i>Śatasāhasrikāprajñāpāramitā</i>). The 'Perfection of Wisdom in Eight Thousand Stanzas' enjoyed a central role in the Buddhist cult of the book, and particularly in Newar Buddhism. The manuscript is protected by two painted wooden covers. </p>"," A palm-leaf manuscripts containing Rāhulabhadra 's Prajñāpāramitāstotra and the Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā.
